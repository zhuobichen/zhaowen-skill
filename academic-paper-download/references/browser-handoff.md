# Exact Browser Download Handoff

Use this workflow only after resolving or confirming a DOI and when automatic
OA retrieval is exhausted or the publisher requires the user's current browser
session. Do not pass a publisher URL to `fetch.py`.

## Choose the Backend Explicitly

- Choose `chrome` when the user's current Chrome already has an authorized
  institution session. This is the preferred recommendation in that case.
- Choose `cloakbrowser` only when the user requests the optional isolated
  executor and can use a dedicated persistent profile. Read
  [cloakbrowser-handoff.md](cloakbrowser-handoff.md) before running it.
- Never switch from Chrome to CloakBrowser because a login, SSO, MFA,
  entitlement, or subscription attempt failed. Stop, report the failure, and
  ask the user to choose the next backend explicitly.

CloakBrowser is only a browser-handoff backend. It is not a `PaperTransport`
and does not replace Crossref, Unpaywall, Semantic Scholar, arXiv, or their
ordinary HTTP requests.

## Chrome Workflow

## Safety and Binding

Preserve the user's logged-in session without reading, exporting, or requesting
cookies, passwords, API keys, or session tokens. Never bypass CAPTCHA, paywalls,
browser security warnings, or authentication. Keep unrelated tabs open.

Bind the download by browser download ID/GUID when available, otherwise by a
collision-free exact filename planned before download. Never scan Downloads or
select its newest PDF. Stop if neither exact binding is possible.

## Exact Filename Workflow

1. Plan a staging filename in the browser Downloads directory:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/runtime.py" browser-finalize plan-save \
  --downloads-dir "$HOME/Downloads" \
  --author 'First Author' --year '2024' \
  --title 'Concise paper title' --doi '10.1038/example'
```

2. Snapshot that exact path before starting the browser download:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/runtime.py" browser-finalize snapshot \
  --downloads-dir "$HOME/Downloads" \
  --expected-filename 'FirstAuthor_2024_Concise_paper_title.pdf' \
  --output /tmp/academic-paper-download.snapshot.json
```

3. Start the authorized browser download and retain its ID when exposed.

4. Finalize only the snapshot-bound file into an explicit final directory:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/runtime.py" browser-finalize finalize \
  --snapshot /tmp/academic-paper-download.snapshot.json \
  --expected-filename 'FirstAuthor_2024_Concise_paper_title.pdf' \
  --filename 'FirstAuthor_2024_Concise_paper_title.pdf' \
  --output-dir ./papers \
  --doi '10.1038/example' \
  --title 'Concise paper title' \
  --source-url 'https://publisher.example/article'
```

Add `--download-id ID` when available. Browser Downloads is only exact-bound
staging; `finalize` always requires `--output-dir`. By default its manifest uses
`access_basis=user_authorized_browser` and `license_status=unknown`. Supply
`--license-status`, `--license`, `--license-url`, `--host-type`, or
`--article-version` only when the caller has explicitly verified those facts.

The finalizer rejects pre-snapshot files, symbolic links, partial downloads,
HTML, truncated PDFs, and invalid output directories. It parses at least one
page, checks `%%EOF`, verifies scholarly identity from bounded metadata and
first-page evidence, copies atomically, verifies size/SHA-256, and commits the
manifest last. Identity mismatch or unresolved identity exits without moving
the exact browser download into the final output or writing a success manifest.
The original browser download remains available for explicit manual review.

## Human Action

When login, SSO, CAPTCHA, VPN, browser setup, or a security decision requires
the user, stop retries. On macOS first attempt:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/runtime.py" notify-human \
  --title 'Paper download needs your action' \
  --message 'Complete the publisher login, then return to this chat.' \
  --button 'OK'
```

Treat the dialog as shown only with exit code `0`, `ok: true`,
`data.shown: true`, and `data.chat_fallback_required: false`; otherwise present
the same minimum action in chat. Wait for the user to report completion, then
verify the blocker is gone before continuing.
